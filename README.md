# nav_challenge_for_jerry

Ok, Jerry here is the challenge with this. There are 2 pages in this App, A and B. Each page has a TextBox to represent UI state. Now try to create the following nav stack where the UI state is preserved when navigating back. Type in each page different content.

E.g.
BackStack       : A(Hi) -> B(there) -> A(navigtion) -> B(stack)
